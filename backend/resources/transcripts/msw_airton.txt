the guys, it's a Selena 5 * 13 V champion
 for me I was like a child with nothing you know I didn't have gear to train you know I didn't have boards at the time everything was like expensive you know and everything happens because I was still dreaming and I didn't go to school you know because the patient was for ocean was like you Chino
 I was going to the water everyday every single day I didn't do nothing about it you know I don't have a really difficult to do what they're doing a lot of those. Given up on something you know I really like to push my limit in this come true you know a lot of people tell me why you're choosing strapless I say
 I'm going to do it I'm going to do my best I got to train my life's crazy if it takes ten years to train five years of shine I don't care but it would never stop dreaming I will go there Monday for sure is going to be possible
this year I have to say things didn't go as planned and you know because I did an injury and I threw out my possibility to be world champion again for regular King of the air and I did the trigger was working on you know and then the wind one catch me back and I just fall really hard on the water with my arm open because I lose control you have two fractured cartilage in normally this injury couldn't move remove sneezing was so painful moving was so painful get out of bed was so painful you know I'd like 4 weeks which was like couldn't do nothing you know
 what do you have a big dream a big goal and you can't do it that is the most painful thing that's going to happen
if you like that Visions if you put goals you can do it or maybe I dreamed this seem scared at all. I'm competing in the LA Pride boarding Advance strapless just to be a dream but then that is the way I don't have Advantage there but I believe I can do it
 as I say I don't like the words that I can possibly I know that I can do it I just need the right time that I conditions and this year I never been this repaired enough I never liked / been training like crazy this one more year with no one stopped raining and no but unfortunately like 20 days before the van I enjoyed myself as I say it like happened just got to take these out of motivation to come back stronger you know do for me nothing is impossible and more motivated than ever to try to prove to people that I can do it
 people are saying like double under passes with strapless was impossible and I proved to them that is possible because I did stuff that people were saying was impossible for years what keeps me going until now was to believe in myself
 I know a lot of athletes in my guy to community their likes care of their skills you know they don't want to try to push harder because maybe they know they can do for me what I learned I'm here and that I've been going to water not for training I go underwater for a living fan you know and when you are having fun everything is coming your way and I like for me when I wake up I see the forecast is pumping is like crazy wins and big waves I got to go there and have fun because I want things child of dreaming to travel the world and serve the best conditions
 I don't take this job as another training the best job of my life the best thing that could happen to me
 this is a perfect time of my career that I can upgrade all my tricks because I have time so you don't have time to think about your ex and a great occasion to like learn while it's possible for the future
 I have I know how many visions that I think things can be really possible you know that. Vision
 I thought that my nephew is saying but in my vision is under percent and when I go back I'm going to do it and got a performance I'm going to put the card in my hand bro I'm going to lend the craziest thing in the world man for sure
 the words I want to say that my community by go home like the kids to always tell them like life is it impossible to do what you love and things going to come in their way
 one of the things are tan said that really jumped out to me was that he continued with strapless writing even though everyone told him it was impossible for him to compete at the highest level and despite all the negative comments are Tom carried on and really had the courage to follow its path
 never giving up and believing it's possible especially when people tell you it's not possible well that's where it starts its how bad you really want something and I remember when I was working on my project in Egypt was flying my wingsuit above the pyramids I told my team I was dreaming to Fly Above the pyramids with my Wing suits and the first reaction of everyone was that like it is impossible it's never going to happen then to me that was really like the motivation to show everyone and prove everyone that it was possible and we could make it happen strapless I don't know straps you know a lot of people telling me why you're choosing strapless I say I chose this job is because I still believe in people are saying like double and the fastest with Travis was impossible and I hate the word impossible because I did stuff that people was
 when was impossible for years and I prove to them that is possible
 another interesting thing is that a lot of people are scared of their skills it's a fear of winning in fact because you don't want to fail and we've heard it before but the idea of enjoying what you do and really having fun and not looking at it as a as a training or as a work makes whole difference another interesting thing is having the patience to wait for the right time I really believe life is about timing and finally I love his voice I mean the way a person speaks has already happiness and energy and that's for me like one of the most important thing
 dreamy something we do easily When We Were Young what they want to be when they grow up and they might say but maybe dreaming comes easier when we were young because we have our whole lives ahead of us but it's also true that at that age we haven't yet learned to limit ourselves in was easy to dismiss a child's dream as being unrealistic who's to say someone's going to go up in the rockets and win big at the Oscars so first comes to dream then the reality and just because something goes against the grain or hasn't been done before it doesn't mean it's impossible
 in his studies on high Achievers Harvard psychologist David McClelland found the one characteristic they all shared was they think fantasize and dream constantly about how to improve their performance and achieved their goals
 some dreams give birth to ideas that seem so outlandish and so revolutionary that other people can't imagine them but as many people including one of the world's old-time grade boxer Muhammad Ali set
 and airtones Story shows us how even though everyone around him so his dream was impossible having a dream and holding on tight to his vision gave him the drive to overcome adversity focus on his goal and keep on pushing forward
 so how do we make dreaming a key part of our daily lives and how can we harness or dreams so they helped push us to be more successful in fields coming up are some steps you can all take as you dare to dream and remember this framework is here to help you at structure to your lead into the end
 the first thing you have to do is to be prepared and flicker into our brains at any time of the day so create a phone note to carry a sheet of paper and have it ready all the time
 remember to be patient and don't panic if nothing materializes straight away it may take multiple attempts to open up his creative side of your brain
 secondly alongside catching Seven Rings clear time in your schedule every day week or even month for brainstorming and reflecting maybe even started the end of this episode
 find a relaxing environment clear yourself of all distractions by closing your inbox during your phone to silence and taking a deep breath
 write down everything you love to do one day however crazy it seems just scribbled on your thoughts and don't edit anything no limits no bad ideas no reality just saying back to the way we used to dream when we were younger and visualize the words and braised the moment and allow your dreams to take you in any direction
 give it some time it could be as little as a few weeks or perhaps a couple of months but once you've build a list on paper the next step of course is to take action
 look over what you've written what instantly sticks out to you what resonates with the direction you want to go in life is there something career-oriented you want to pursue a country you want to visit a sport you want to master or even once-in-a-lifetime event you want to attend
 focus on the dreams you feel are meaningful and really important to you even if they seem unrealistic at first you'll be more likely to succeed in the things that you did you care about
 from here we can really start to turn our dreams into reality AKA and achievable goal
